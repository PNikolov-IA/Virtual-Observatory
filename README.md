### Project Description:
    Open-source application written in Typescript.
    The project Virtual Observatory is a database storage 
    for astronomical observations and data acquiring/retrieving. 
    Actually it was realised as reference database for 
    describe/identification of astronomical objects and it can provide basic data information, 
    cross-identifications, and astronomical observations of the objects.
    In the project were used Nestjs and TypeORM for a back-end logic, 
    and MariaDB/MySQL database servers for a relational database design.
